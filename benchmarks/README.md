# Benchmarks

Benchmarks implement automatic runs of CLI for different use-cases with
the objective of quickly and easily verify if the components are communicating and running as
expected according to the Enablers functionalities and the requested CLI command.

## Implemented Use-cases

### 1. Train: Full Pipeline with eGeMAPS

This use-case means that the user is requiring the whole pipeline (SSL + SL) train using eGeMAPS as input
to the SSL encoder pre-training. The workflow is highlighted and depicted in this
figure: [Full pipeline eGeMAPS use-case].

### 2. Train: Full Pipeline with Standardize

This use-case means that the user is requiring the whole pipeline (SSL + SL) train using Standardize as input
to the SSL encoder pre-training. The workflow is highlighted and depicted in this
figure: [Full pipeline Standardize use-case].
